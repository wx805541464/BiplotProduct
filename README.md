# BiplotProduct
What is a Biplot?
Biplot is a perceptual map providing a visual summary of the ratings of three or more products on a set of product characteristics, including some measure(s) of acceptance.

Biplot help to answer research questions such as:
What attributes are driving brand differences?  
What is the difference between good (better) and bad (worse) brands?
What brands are similar/different?
What characteristics are driving change over time?
What drives overall liking at the category (macro) level?


This is the implementation of the biplot using python. It is mainly based on the algorithm of pca(Principal Component Analysis).

The script relies on several standard scientific Python packages: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, & matplotlib.
